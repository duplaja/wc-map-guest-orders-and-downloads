WC Map Guest Orders and Downloads maps WooCommerce guest orders and downloads to an account with the same e-mail on account creation or login.

== Description ==

**Note: You MUST have WooCommerce installed and activated for this plugin to work. WC 3.0+ compliant** 

WC Map Guest Orders and Downloads does exactly what the title says. We've all had customers order something from our site, and then later decide to create an account. Especially with downloadable products, this can cause an issue where logged in users can't view their past orders or downloads. We address this here by checking the billing e-mail address on past guest orders when an account is created or a user logs in, and if it matches the e-mail set on the user account, the appropriate orders and downloads are mapped to the new account.

This is a simple little pluggin, with no settings, no options, just install, activate, and go!
